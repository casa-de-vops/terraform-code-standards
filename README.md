# Terraform Coding Standards for Azure Infrastructure Projects

## Overview

This project aims to establish a comprehensive set of Terraform coding standards designed for enterprise-level projects. The goal is to ensure consistency, maintainability, and best practices across all Terraform configurations within the organization. These standards will guide Terraform code development, enabling teams to collaborate effectively and create robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure.

## Introduction

As organizations scale their infrastructure using Terraform, maintaining consistency and adherence to best practices becomes crucial. This project sets forth a standardized approach to writing, organizing, and managing Terraform code within enterprise environments. The standards outlined here are intended to be flexible enough to accommodate various use cases while being strict enough to ensure quality and security.

## Why Coding Standards?

- **Consistency:** Ensure all Terraform code follows a uniform structure and style, making it easier for teams to collaborate.
- **Maintainability:** Facilitate code reviews, updates, and debugging by adhering to clear guidelines.
- **Security:** Incorporate best practices to safeguard against common security vulnerabilities in infrastructure code.
- **Scalability:** Enable infrastructure to grow and evolve without becoming unmanageable.
- **Compliance:** Align with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.

## Scope

These standards are based on my experience as a DevOps engineer primarily working in the Azure cloud environment. While many of these recommendations are general enough to apply across different cloud platforms—such as AWS and Google Cloud—they are scoped to reflect best practices and lessons learned from Azure-centric projects. Users are encouraged to adapt these standards as necessary to fit the specific needs and characteristics of other cloud environments.

These guidelines are intended for use by DevOps engineers, cloud architects, and developers involved in infrastructure management, particularly within Azure-based projects.

## Coding Standards

The **Coding Standards** section provides comprehensive guidelines to ensure consistency and best practices across your codebase. It includes documentation on [Directory Structure](./docs/directory_structure.md), [Domain Specific Files](./docs/domain_specific_files.md), [Naming Conventions](./docs/naming_conventions.md#naming-conventions), [Resource and State Management](./docs/resource_and_state_management.md), [Modules](./docs/module.md), [Variables and Outputs](./docs/variables_and_outputs.md), [Version Control](./docs/version_control.md), [Documentation](./docs/documentation.md), and [Testing and Validation](./docs/testing_and_validation.md). This section ensures that all team members adhere to a uniform set of coding practices, facilitating maintainability and scalability.

## Azure DevOps Workflows

The Azure DevOps Workflows section offers a set of reusable and scalable templates designed to automate the Terraform workflow across multiple environments in Azure. This includes validation, planning, security scanning, and applying Terraform configurations. The pipelines are parameterized to accommodate different environments and workloads, streamlining infrastructure management and enhancing deployment efficiency.

 1. [Deployment Pipeline](./.azuredevops/DEPLOY.md)
   - **Purpose:** Automates the validation, planning, inspection (security scanning), and application of Terraform configurations.
   - **Features:**
     - Validates Terraform configurations.
     - Generates execution plans.
     - Scans configurations for security vulnerabilities.
     - Applies the Terraform configurations to manage infrastructure across different environments.

 2. [Unlock Pipeline](./.azuredevops/UNLOCK.md)
   - **Purpose:** Automates the unlocking process of Terraform state files, ensuring that locked states due to failed or interrupted operations can be safely unlocked.
   - **Features:**
     - Unlocks Terraform state files to allow further operations.
     - Validates that the state has been successfully unlocked.
     - Supports multiple environments and is fully parameterized.
