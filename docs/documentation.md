### Documentation

- Document all modules, variables, and outputs using Markdown files or inline comments. Well-documented code is crucial for maintaining clarity and ensuring that the purpose and functionality of each module are easily understood.
- Use **`tfdocs`** (Terraform Docs) to automatically generate documentation for your Terraform modules. This tool extracts information about resources, variables, outputs, and more from your Terraform files and formats it into a Markdown file.
- Provide a `README.md` for each module explaining its purpose, inputs, and outputs. By using `tfdocs`, you can ensure that your documentation is consistent, up-to-date, and includes all necessary details about your Terraform modules.
